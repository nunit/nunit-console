<!--
Having problems? NUnit is run entirely by volunteers from the community, but we're keen to help!

To help the others diagnose and reproduce your issue, please include as many of the following as relevant:
- The full command line being used
- Method of installation (e.g. NuGet, zip, msi)
- Log files (Run the console with --trace=Debug to produce these)
- Version of the NUnit Engine/Console
- All versions of the NUnit Framework in use
- Whether the behaviour is any different when the tests are run using the --inprocess flag
-->
