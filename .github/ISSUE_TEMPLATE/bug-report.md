<!--
Thanks for filing a bug report with NUnit! NUnit is run entirely by volunteers from the community, so we welcome pull requests and contributions in all areas.

To help the others diagnose and reproduce your issue, please include as many of the following as relevant:
- The full command line being used
- Method of installation (e.g. NuGet, zip, msi)
- Log files (Run the console with --trace=Debug to produce these)
- Version of the NUnit Engine/Console
- All versions of the NUnit Framework in use
- Whether the behaviour is any different when the tests are run using the --inprocess flag
